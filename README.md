🚗 Automotive Sales Demand Forecasting

📍 Sep 2025 – Oct 2025 | Python, ARIMA, Prophet, Time Series Forecasting

📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on forecasting automotive sales using time series analysis.
By leveraging demographic and regional sales data, ARIMA, and Prophet models, the project predicts 6-month car sales to improve inventory planning, stock alignment, and product launch strategies.

Key goals:
- Identify demand patterns across market segments and product types.
- Apply ARIMA and Prophet models to forecast future sales.
- Evaluate model performance and select the best approach for seasonal vs. stable demand.
- Provide actionable recommendations to optimize inventory allocation.

🎯 Problem Addressed
- Perform exploratory analysis to understand sales patterns across demographic and regional segments
- Apply time series forecasting models (ARIMA and Prophet) to predict monthly car sales
- Evaluate and compare model accuracy to demonstrate forecasting proficiency and practical application in demand - planning

⚙️ Research Study
- What are the key business insights to optimize car sales in upcoming months?
- Which model provides better predictive accuracy for demand planning purposes?
- What is the demand volume for the next 6-months to support planning allocation?
